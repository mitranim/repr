## Overview

Prints Go data structures as syntactically valid Go code. Useful for code generation. The name "repr" stands for "representation" and alludes to the Python function with the same name.

Solves a problem unaddressed by https://github.com/davecgh/go-spew/spew; direct alternative to https://github.com/shurcooL/go-goon.

See godoc at https://godoc.org/github.com/mitranim/repr.

## Example

```go
import "github.com/mitranim/repr"

type Data struct {
  Number int
  String string
  List   []int
}

repr.Println(Data{
  Number: 123,
  String: "hello world!",
  List:   []int{10, 20, 30},
})

/*
Data{
  Number: 123,
  String: "hello world!",
  List: []int{10, 20, 30},
}
*/
```
